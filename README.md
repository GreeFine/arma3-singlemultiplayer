# arma3-singlemultiplayer

A DLL mod for Arma3, that simulate a multiplayer experience on a singleplayer scenario.

# Prototype working
Rust works great to do this simple DLL and worked nicely on Arma3</br>
Connection between my udp server and my loaded DLL works great.

# Can't go any further
I would have like to do working multiplayer with this, and i wanted to make custom game modes with this.</br>
But the Scripting API of Arma3 is very limited almost non existant for controling units/player models
